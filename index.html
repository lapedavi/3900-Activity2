                Hello, my name is David Lape, I am a major in management information systems attending the University
                of Nebraska at Omaha also known as UNO. I am currently a software developer and am on track to getting
                my degree by the end of next year, I have programming experience and IT experience from multiple employers
                ranging from acadamia positions and up to businesses. I have been working as a software developer for
                3 years and before that was in IT for 2 years, as a software developer I primarly use TypeScript, C#, JavaScript,
                HTML, and SQL. As I've been is school however, I have learned or taken classes in Java, C++, and Python.
                The newest thing I am learning about is cloud computing and hosting companies servers and databases with
                Amazon Web Services. Eventually I hope to at least have my bachelors degree and either be in management of
                development teams or become a project manager for technology projects.
            </p>
