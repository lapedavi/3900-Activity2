            <h2>Soot</h2>
            <p>
                Soot was adopted from Petsmart and will turn 3 in May, she was my girlfriend and now Wifes birthday present.
                Soot is very soft and cuddly and we never knew she would grow to be as big as she is today. A funny story about Soot
                is that when we adopted her, she thought she was a he, PetSmart informed us that Soot was a boy which we laugh about
                because they also said he was neutered and I have always wondered how they mixed up the gender after they fixed her.

            <h2>Alby</h2>
            <p>
                Alby was adopted from an animal shelter 6 months after Soot and turns 3 in December, he was a present from my
                significant other but I sometimes think she just didn't want Soot to be lonely. We adopted Alby the day after christmas
                and he's been my best friend ever since. While he is cuddly he causes a great deal more of trouble than Soot does. Since
                I gave a funny story about Soot I should also give one for Alby. When Alby was brought home Soot immediately turned demonic
                and hated everyone as she was no longer the center of attention, she would hide under the bed and hiss at whoever came near her.
                I had worried we would have to take Alby back but eventually she warmed up to him and now they are the best of friends.
